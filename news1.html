            <p>It was another goalless draw, which is sure to leave a bitter taste in the mouth after what was a solid performance. AC Milan come away from Turin and will have to, again, settle for a point. Serie A matchday 32 has put AC Milan's position at the top of the table under threat but the title race is still wide open. Here are the stats from tonight's game:
                <ol>
                    <li>AC Milan have drawn nil-nil in two Serie A games in a row for the first time since December 2018, also against Torino and Bologna.</li>
                    <li>The Rossoneri have kept a clean sheet in five straight Serie A games, this is their best streak since August 2021 (six in that case).</li>
                    <li> AC Milan have failed to score in two consecutive Serie A games for the first time since February 2021.</li>
                    <li>Davide Calabria started his 150th game for AC Milan in all competitions, while Brahim Díaz has made 50 starts.</li>
                </ol>

            <p>0-0 again. At the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino, AC Milan played with intensity, courage and determination but, for the second consecutive match, weren’t able to find the net. After the home draw against Bologna on Monday, the Rossoneri were involved in another goalless stalemate this evening, this time against the Granata. The team displayed a lot of heart and created plenty of dangerous moments, but they lacked precision up top. While Coach Pioli’s men have now kept five consecutive clean sheets in the league, this result only represents a small step forward in terms of the standings. After three wins in March, the Rossoneri are going through a bit more of a difficult spell when it comes to their performances and adding to their points tally, but they still lead the way in Serie A. The fact that Ibra, Bennacer, Castillejo and Rebić were forced to withdraw so late (thus adding to an injury list that already contained Romagnoli, Florenzi and Kjær) meant that the Coach didn’t have as many options as he would have liked, but the group will keep fighting with the same spirit as they look to return to winning ways against Genoa at San Siro on Friday. Let’s continue to believe!
