            <h3>AC MILAN V GENOA: A PREVIOUS MEETING</h3>
            <h4>The Rossoneri kicked off 2010 with a comprehensive victory: let's look back at that 5-2 success</h4>
            <p>It's one of AC Milan's final home fixtures of the season, and it's a vital one too: AC Milan v Genoa is coming up on Friday. The Rossoneri have already faced the Rossoblù twice this season, once in the league (a 3-0 win thanks to a Messias brace and a goal from Ibrahimović) and once in the Coppa Italia (a 3-1 extra-time victory following goals from Giroud, Leão and Saelemaekers). The third encounter will see a new face in the opposition dugout - that of Blessin, the Rossoblù's third coach of the season (after Ballardini and Shevchenko). Another interesting chapter awaits, but let's go back a few pages first and relive the showdown that took place on 6 January 2010.<br>
                <h4>SETTING THE SCENE</h4>
                It was matchday 18 of the 2009/10 Serie A season and AC Milan's first fixture of 2010. The Rossoneri were finally back on the pitch after a month without playing: their matchday 17 clash away to Fiorentina, which was scheduled to take place just before Christmas, had been postponed due to the snowy weather. Leonardo's side had qualified for the round of 16 of the Champions League and were going well in Italy, sitting in second place on 31 points behind Inter. The team were looking to bounce back at San Siro following their 2-0 home defeat to Palermo in their previous fixture.
                <h4>PENALTY DRAMA</h4>
                There was plenty of excitement for the return of Beckham, who was back for his second loan spell with the Club and went straight into the starting line-up. With Pato out, Ronaldinho and Borriello were selected in attack. The game kicked off and it seemed like the Rossoneri were about to take the lead following Biava's foul on Ambrosini in the box on the twelve-minute mark. Ronaldinho stepped up to take the resulting penalty, but Amelia guessed correctly and kept it out. The Diavolo then paid the price: on their first meaningful foray forward, Genoa went in front, with Sculli heading past Abate from close range. However, it was only a temporary setback as AC Milan responded well. On the half-hour mark, following Borriello's lay-off, captain Ambrosini was once again brought down in the area, with Amelia mistiming his challenge. Ronaldinho made no mistake this time, sending the goalkeeper the wrong way with a more powerful and convincing finish. With the wind in their sails, it didn't take long for the Rossoneri to find the net again. In the 38th minute, two of the team's defenders took centre stage as Nesta's cross caused havoc and Thiago Silva eventually turned home.<br>
                <h4>WOW, BORRIELLO</h4>
                In the second half, Borriello - the team's top scorer that season - stole the show. With 48 minutes on the clock, Ronaldino played a wonderful through ball for Antonini, who found Marco for an easy tap-in. On the hour mark, the striker produced a truly spectacular left-footed overhead kick that kissed the post on its way in. Off came his shirt as the stadium exploded with joy. A brace for him and four goals for AC Milan, making the final stages very comfortable. There was still room for a goal from Huntelaar, who coolly converted another penalty, and a consolation for the visitors, with Suazo reducing the arrears. It finished 5-2.
